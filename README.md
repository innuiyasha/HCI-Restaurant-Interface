# HCI-Restaurant-Interface

This was an assignment in CPSC 481 where we were tasked with creating a restaurant ordering system to be ultimately deployed on a touch-screen based display. The restaurant in question was an on-campus pub called 'The Den.'

This was my first real intoduction to GIT so my apologies for my poor git messaging.
